  subtitle: "The Compass Story"
  description: "Compass was founded by Gustavo Marques Alberici, a high school student who wanted to create a space where students could support and learn from one another. What began as his small idea to make the school community more connected and encouraging has grown into a structured mentorship program built on empathy, leadership, and genuine care. From its start, Compass has aimed to bridge students across grade levels — creating opportunities for mentorship, guidance, and real connection. Today, Gustavo and the Compass team continue to grow that mission, uniting passionate mentors who strive to make a lasting impact in every student's journey."
