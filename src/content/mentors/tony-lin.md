bio: "My name is Tony Lin, and I'm a curious student with a strong passion for math and science. I enjoy thinking logically and approaching problems from different perspectives to find the best solutions. As a boarding student at Windermere Preparatory School, I've learned to be independent, responsible, and adaptable while building strong friendships and a sense of community. I take pride in managing my time well and balancing my academics with my hobbies, which has helped me stay calm and focused when facing challenges. I genuinely enjoy helping others and believe in growing together as a team rather than focusing only on individual success."
