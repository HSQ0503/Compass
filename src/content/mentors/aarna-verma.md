bio: "My name is Aarna Verma, and I’m a natural-born leader who values independence and always takes initiative in everything I do. I take pride in managing my time well and helping others stay focused on what truly matters, while also keeping a healthy balance between productivity and enjoyment. My love for volleyball has taught me dedication, teamwork, and leadership, both on and off the court. I’m also deeply interested in anatomy and biology, and I hope to pursue a career in the medical field one day, where I can continue helping people in meaningful ways. Though I may seem reserved at first, once I open up, my warmth and enthusiasm shine through. I strive to lead with compassion, responsibility, and positivity in everything I do."
