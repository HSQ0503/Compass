bio: "My name is Gustavo Campos , mostly known as Guga, I am a  student entrepreneur who somehow manages to turn every random idea into a real project. I’ve built businesses, nonprofits, and probably already grown a few gray hairs along the way. I like chasing big dreams, solving problems that don’t have real easy answers, and making people laugh while doing it. I believe in ambition with a sense of humor, because if you’re not having fun, what’s the point."
