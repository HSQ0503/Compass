  - question: "What is Compass and how does it work?"
    answer: "Compass is a student-to-student mentorship program that connects middle and high school students with peer mentors. Through one-on-one and classroom sessions, mentors help students build academic, social, and personal skills with support from school counselors and the Compass team."
  - question: "How much does the program cost?"
    answer: "Compass is completely free for all students. As a nonprofit organization, our mission is to ensure every student has access to quality peer mentorship regardless of their financial situation."
  - question: "Who are the mentors and how are they selected?"
    answer: "All Compass mentors are dedicated high school students who demonstrate strong academic performance, leadership, and involvement in school life. To become a mentor, each student must complete an official Compass form that includes their own signature, a parent or guardian signature, and approvals from a school counselor and administrator. The Compass Board, along with school staff, reviews every application to ensure each mentor is qualified and ready to represent Compass responsibly."
  - question: "How long does the mentorship program last?"
    answer: "Compass mentorship runs throughout the entire school year. Mentees meet with their mentors on a schedule that works best for themâ€”whether that's weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Our team and school counselors check in periodically to ensure each mentorship stays consistent and meaningful. At the end of every session, mentors ask their mentees when they'd like to meet again, allowing each pair to set a schedule that fits their needs."
  - question: "How do I get matched with my mentors?"
    answer: "After you fill out the Compass mentee form, our Mentor Coordinator reviews your responses and works with your school counselor to help identify the best fit for you. Together, they match you with mentors who align with your goals, interests, and needs. We consider your academic subjects, extracurricular activities, and the areas where you'd like extra guidance to connect you with mentors who can help you grow."
  - question: "What if I don't connect well with one of my mentors?"
    answer: "We understand that not every mentorship pairing is perfect. If you're not connecting with a mentor, simply reach out to your coordinator and we'll work to find a better match for you."
  - question: "What topics can I discuss with my mentors?"
    answer: "You can discuss anything related to your academic and personal growth, including time management, study strategies, extracurricular balance, college preparation, social challenges, and navigating high school life."
  - question: "How do I sign up for Compass?"
    answer: "Getting started is easy! Simply contact us through our website, and our coordinator will reach out to schedule an initial consultation to understand your needs and match you with the right mentors."
